# Validation Scope Statement

## Validated Components
The following components are validated for forensic use under
UK FSR Statutory Code v2 and ISO/IEC 17025:

- Core Nexus
- SRA Pinning Mechanism
- Immutable Chain-of-Custody Ledger
- Report Generator

## Non-Validated Components
The following components are provided **for transparency and disclosure only**
and are NOT part of the validated forensic method:

- Audit Verification Tool (AVT)
  - Location: tools/audit-verify
  - Purpose: Independent third-party verification
  - Status: Non-operational, non-analytical, audit-only

## Legal Rationale
The AVT does not process evidence, generate findings, or influence forensic outcomes.
It exists solely to allow defense experts and auditors to independently verify
cryptographic integrity and practitioner authorization.

Inclusion of this tool does not affect the validated status of the forensic method.
