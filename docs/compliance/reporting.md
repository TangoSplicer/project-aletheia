# Forensic Reporting & Disclosure (UK FSR / CPS)

## 1. Admissibility
Reports generated by Project Aletheia are designed to be "Defence-Resilient." By including the full **Audit Trail** from the CoC ledger directly in the report, the practitioner provides immediate transparency regarding the integrity of the data.

## 2. Disclosure Requirements (CPIA 1996)
Under the **Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996**, all material that may undermine the prosecution case or assist the defence must be disclosed.
- The **Immutable Ledger** JSONL file should be considered "Unused Material" and logged on the MG6 schedule.
- Any **Forensic Non-Conformance** events recorded during the case must be explicitly disclosed.

## 3. Automated vs. Manual Content
- **Automated:** Case metadata, Hashing, CoC Audit Trail, Verification Status.
- **Practitioner Owned:** The "Observations" section must be reviewed and can be supplemented by the practitioner to ensure contextual accuracy.

## 4. Verification of Report Integrity
The final SHA-256 hash of the generated report is appended to the ledger. Any subsequent alteration of the report file (e.g., changing a date or finding) will result in a hash mismatch when verified against the ledger, ensuring the report's "Point of Origin" integrity.
