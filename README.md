## ⚖️ Court-Admissible & Regulator-Ready
Project Aletheia is a 2026-specification digital forensic framework engineered to meet the **Forensic Science Regulator (FSR) Statutory Code v2** requirements. Unlike legacy tools, Aletheia prioritizes **Verification of Method** through automated alignment with the **Aletheia SRA (Standard Reference Artifact) Library**.

### Core Pillars
* **FSR-Compliant by Design:** Integrated non-conformance logging and standard reference checking.
* **Validated Core:** Rust-based memory-safe ingestion and BLAKE3/SHA-256 dual-hashing.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Human-in-the-loop triage for deepfake and synthetic media detection.
* **Jurisdiction Switch:** Toggle logic and terminology between UK (FSR), USA (NIST/Daubert), and EU (AI Act).

## 🛡️ Disclosure
This software is intended for use by competent forensic practitioners. All automated findings must be verified by a human expert in accordance with Part B of the FSR Statutory Code.
