## ⚖️ Court-Admissible & Regulator-Ready
Project Aletheia is a 2026-specification digital forensic framework engineered to meet the **Forensic Science Regulator (FSR) Statutory Code v2** requirements. Unlike legacy tools, Aletheia prioritizes **Verification of Method** through automated alignment with the **Aletheia SRA (Standard Reference Artifact) Library**.

### Core Pillars
* **FSR-Compliant by Design:** Integrated non-conformance logging and standard reference checking.
* **Validated Core:** Rust-based memory-safe ingestion and BLAKE3/SHA-256 dual-hashing.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Human-in-the-loop triage for deepfake and synthetic media detection.
* **Jurisdiction Switch:** Toggle logic and terminology between UK (FSR), USA (NIST/Daubert), and EU (AI Act).

## Aletheia Seal Desk dashboard

The React/TypeScript **Aletheia Seal Desk** source is included in [`dashboard/`](dashboard/). It provides local-first Ed25519 manifest verification, BLAKE3 ledger review, encrypted vault restoration, case-audit inspection, verification-profile governance, maker–checker approval controls, and an administrator approval queue. The dashboard’s [README](dashboard/README.md), [user guide](dashboard/USER_GUIDE.md), [operations runbook](dashboard/OPERATIONS_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md), and [security policy](dashboard/SECURITY.md) define its installation, security, and deployment boundaries.
