# Security Policy

## Forensic Integrity Warning
Vulnerabilities in forensic software can lead to evidence contamination or "anti-forensics" exploits. We treat security reports with the highest priority.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest release is supported for forensic use.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues. Email `security@project-aletheia.local` using our PGP key.

## Forensic Non-Conformance
If a vulnerability affects the **integrity of evidence** (e.g., hash collisions, incorrect parsing), please file a **Forensic Non-Conformance Report** using our issue template.
