                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
that when a modified program is run on a server, its source code is
made available to the public. In the case of software used on network
servers, the ordinary GNU General Public License might permit a
version to be used but not shared; this license avoids that problem.
